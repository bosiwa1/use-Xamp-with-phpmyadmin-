# use-Xamp-with-phpmyadmin- Apache server locally 
Create a web page using HTML with PHP  and connect it to the Xamp Apache server (use phpmyadmin )

let stat 
Install Xampp on your local computer:  type in the terminal window brew install xampp for mac or ... or 
optional, just go  Xamp website and download Xamp for your computer system version and install it on your computer  
So the xamp folder will be installed in your local drive, computer or in the application memory where your apps are installed 
Now  go to the Xamp folder, you will see these two more important folders for us (manager-osx folder and htdocs folder)
Now,  to open Xamp,  click  on the Manager-osx folder icon it will open Xamp 
Now, after you Open Xamp, you will Xamp dashboard  and then you  will see 3 buttons in the top centre of the Xamp dashboard  : (Welcome, manager server, server even )

Now we need to run the Apache server and  MySQL, so go click on  the Manager Server  button, you will see these buttons (MySQL Database and Apache web server )  
Run  (MySQL Database and Apache web server  ), just click on both and then click start.
Now the server is running and the database is running too, 
so go see and create a database and tables  on this server, type in your browers https://locallhost/phpmyadmin  


Now, create your web application page that you will connect to your database via PHP 
Create anywhere a folder called the PHP folder 
open one of the favourite write text code editors (IDE)
Open your PHP folder in Visual Studio to create your code   
Create 3 files inside (connect.php, index.php, search_user.php)

Now take this PHP folder to the Xamp folder, that called htdocs, do copy and paste 
(So this will give me a good connection at the server and database running time to locate these 3 files, because it is then the application  )

to see if your application is running on browsers 
Go to the Xamp dashboard and then click on the welcome button. You will see the button, it is called (go to application, go to application folder ) 
click on go to Application, it will open your appliction on your local host browers.
