Create a web page using HTML with PHP  and connect it to the Xamp Apache server (use phpmyadmin )

let stat 
1 Install Xampp on your local computer:  type in the terminal window brew install xampp for mac or ... or 
2 optional, just go  Xamp website and download Xamp for your computer system version and install it on your computer  
3 So the xamp folder will be installed in your local drive, computer or in the application memory where your apps are installed


4 Now  go to the Xamp folder, you will see these two more important folders for us (manager-osx folder and htdocs folder)

5 Now,  to open Xamp,  click  on the Manager-osx folder icon it will open Xamp 

6 Now, after you Open Xamp, you will Xamp dashboard  and then you  will see 3 buttons in the top centre of the Xamp dashboard  : (Welcome, manager server, server even )

11 Now, create your web application page that you will connect to your database via PHP 

12 Create a folder called the PHP folder 

13 open one of the favourite text code editors (IDE)

14 Open your PHP folder in Visual Studio to create your code

16 Now take this PHP folder to the Xamp folder, that called htdocs, do copy and paste 

(So this will give me a good connection at the server and database running time to locate these 3 files, because it is then the application  )
